# Ludo Engine and Gaming Platform: Architectural Proposal

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive architectural proposal for a Ludo engine and gaming platform. The platform will support single-player and multiplayer modes (up to 4 players), with a web-first approach and future mobile support (Android, then iOS). The design emphasizes scalability, modularity, and a hybrid game engine for optimal performance.

## 1. System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture
- **Frontend Layer**: Web-based SPA for user interaction, game UI, and client-side logic.
- **Backend Layer**: API server for business logic, user management, matchmaking, and real-time communication.
- **Game Engine Layer**: Hybrid engine handling Ludo rules, state management, and validation.
- **Data Layer**: Database for persistent storage of users, games, and analytics.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Cloud hosting, CI/CD, and monitoring.

    | (Single-Player)                               | (Multiplayer)
    v                                              v
[Client-Side Engine] <--- Sync ---> [Server-Side Engine]
                                      |
                                      v
                                [Database]
```

## 2. Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (with Next.js for SSR/SSG) for web SPA.
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
- **State Management**: Redux or Zustand for game state and UI state.
- **Real-Time**: Socket.io client for multiplayer sync.
- **Mobile**: React Native (later) for Android/iOS, reusing React components.

### Backend
- **Language**: Node.js with TypeScript (Express.js) for API server, enabling seamless logic sharing with the frontend and game engine.
- **Real-Time**: Socket.io or WebSockets for game events.
- **Authentication**: JWT or OAuth (e.g., Google/Facebook login).
- **API**: RESTful or GraphQL for flexible data fetching.

### Game Engine
- **Language**: TypeScript for cross-platform compatibility (runs in browser and Node.js), allowing shared logic across frontend and backend.
- **Core Logic**: Pure functions for rules, moves, and state transitions.
- **Hybrid Mode**:
  - Single-Player: Engine runs entirely on client.
  - Multiplayer: Engine runs on server; clients send actions, server validates and broadcasts state.

### Database
- **Type**: NoSQL (MongoDB) for flexible game state storage, or PostgreSQL for relational data.
- **Features**: User profiles, game history, matchmaking queues, leaderboards.

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Vercel/Netlify for frontend; AWS/Azure for backend (EC2, Lambda).
- **Containerization**: Docker for backend services.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking, Prometheus for metrics.

## 3. Game Engine Details

### Core Components
- **GameState**: Represents board, players, tokens, turn order.
- **RulesEngine**: Validates moves, handles captures, win conditions.
- **ActionHandler**: Processes roll dice, move token, etc.
- **EventEmitter**: For real-time updates in multiplayer.

### Hybrid Implementation
- **Single-Player**:
  - Engine instantiated in client.
  - Local state management; no server interaction.
  - Optional cloud sync for progress saving.
- **Multiplayer**:
  - Server maintains authoritative state.
  - Clients send actions (e.g., "move token X by Y steps").
  - Server validates, updates state, broadcasts to all players.
  - Prevents cheating; ensures consistency.

### API Interface
- `createGame(players: Player[])`: Initializes game.
- `rollDice(playerId: string)`: Returns dice value.
- `moveToken(playerId: string, tokenId: string, steps: number)`: Updates state if valid.
- `getState()`: Returns current game state.
- `getValidMoves(playerId: string)`: Lists possible actions.

### Data Structures
- **Board**: 2D array or object with positions (home, start, finish).
- **Player**: { id, color, tokens: Token[], status: 'active' | 'waiting' | 'finished' }
- **Token**: { id, position, state: 'home' | 'in-play' | 'finished' }

## 4. User Onboarding and Features

### Onboarding Flow
- **Registration**: Email/password or social login; optional guest play.
- **Tutorial**: Interactive guide for rules and UI.
- **Profile Setup**: Avatar, nickname, preferences.

### Multiplayer Features
- **Invites**: Share game link or invite friends via email/social.
- **Random Matchmaking**: Queue system for quick matches (1v1, 2v2, etc.).
- **Game Sessions**: Persistent rooms; spectators; chat.
- **Spectator Mode**: Watch ongoing games.

### Single-Player Features
- **AI Opponents**: Bot players for practice.
- **Progress Tracking**: Local/cloud saves, stats, achievements.

## 5. Security and Scalability

### Security
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT tokens; rate limiting.
- **Data Encryption**: HTTPS, encrypted database.
- **Cheat Prevention**: Server-side validation for multiplayer.

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Load balancers for backend.
- **Caching**: Redis for game states and sessions.
- **CDN**: For static assets (images, UI components).

## 6. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (Web Single-Player)
- Basic Ludo engine (client-side).
- Simple UI for gameplay.
- Local storage for progress.

### Phase 2: Multiplayer
- Server-side engine.
- Real-time sync.
- Matchmaking and invites.

### Phase 3: Mobile
- React Native app.
- Native optimizations.

### Phase 4: Enhancements
- AI bots, leaderboards, tournaments.
- Advanced analytics.

## 7. Risks and Mitigations
- **Real-Time Latency**: Use WebRTC for low-latency multiplayer.
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimize engine for mobile hardware.
- **Scalability**: Start with serverless for cost-efficiency.

This proposal provides a solid foundation. Let's review and refine based on your feedback!
